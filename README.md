Welcome to My Portfolio Project
Project Overview

This project is my personal web-development portfolio — a modern, responsive, and fully interactive website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and professional journey as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

The homepage features a clean dark-themed UI with highlighted accent colors, smooth animations, and a strong focus on readability and user experience. It introduces who I am, what I do, and provides quick access to key sections such as About Me, Skills, Services, Certifications, and Contact.

A glowing circular frame displays my profile picture, giving the interface a polished and personal visual identity. The website is built to be fast, accessible, and fully responsive for mobile and desktop users.
